# DVSC

Damn Vulnerable Software Center (DVSC) is a Python web hacking challenge.

## Goal

Teach the concept of time analysis side-channel attacks and TOCTOUs.

- The first part of this challenge is heavily inspired by [W3Challs' Temporal attack](https://w3challs.com/challenges/web/temporal_attack)
